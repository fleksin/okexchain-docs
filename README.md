# Introduction

## What is OKC？

### About OKX Chain
A Super Scalable, Compatible L1 Blockchain OKX Chain (OKC) is an EVM-compatible L1 built on Cosmos with a focus on true interoperability (IBC) and maximized performance. At high scalability, developers can build and scale with low gas fees. The OKX Chain ecosystem and infrastructure, including the all-in-one multi-chain Web3 interface, enables a seamless experience for both developers and users.

### Advantages of OKX Chain
- High Scalability & Maximized Performance: Based on enhanced Tendermint and Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus that can support up to 5000 Transactions per Second (TPS), Web3 applications shall reach their full potential at extremely low cost.
- Enhanced Interoperability: OKX Chain supports Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC)nprotocol that — together with the Tendermint consensus algorithm, featuring instant finality — can be used to realize value transmission between Cosmos ecosystem within seconds. Being fully EVM compatible, OKX Chain allows developers to build projects without any learning cost.
- Developer Friendly: OKX Chain is completely open-source. Anyone can read it, check the progress, comment on it, and help build the ecosystem. OKX Chain also provides native oracle protocol and industry-leader Chainlink for maximum flexibility to access price feeds.
- Secure: The OKX Chain team offers a reliable smart contract auditing service, making it a genuinely decentralized protocol that avoids the centralization risks of most blockchain networks today.

## The OKT

Do you have OKT tokens? With OKT, you have the unique ability to contribute to the security and governance of the OKC. Delegate your OKT to one or more of the 100 validators on the OKC blockchain to earn more OKT through Proof-of-Stake. You can also vote with your OKT to influence the future of the OKC through on-chain governance proposals.

## OKC Explorer

The OKC block explorer allows you to search, view and analyze OKC data—like blocks, transactions, validators as well as other key information.

## OKC CLI

`exchaincli` is a command-line interface that lets you interact with the OKC. `exchaincli` is the only tool that supports 100% of the OKC features, including accounts, transfers, delegation, and governance. Learn more about exchaincli with the [delegator's CLI guide](./delegators/delegators-guide-cli.html).


## Running a full-node on the OKC Testnet

In order to run a full-node on the OKC testnet, you must first [install `exchaind`](./getting-start/install-okc.html). Then, follow [the guide](./getting-start/install-okc.html).

If you would like to run a validator node, follow the [validator setup guide](./validators/validators-guide-cli.html).
