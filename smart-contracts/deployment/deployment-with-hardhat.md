# Deploy With Hardhat

In this tutorial, we explain step-by-step how to create, compile and deploy a simple smart contract on the OKB Chain Testnet using Hardhat.

## What is Hardhat
Hardhat is a development environment to compile, deploy, test, and debug your smart contract.

## Setting up the development environment
### Pre-requisites

- [Node.js v10+ LTS and npm](https://nodejs.org/en "Node.js v10+ LTS and npm") (comes with Node)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/ "Git")

To install hardhat, you need to create an npm project by going to an empty folder, running `npm init`, and following its instructions. You can use another package manager, like yarn, but we recommend you use npm 7 or later, as it makes installing Hardhat plugins simpler.
Once your project is ready, you should run `npm install --save-dev hardhat`
Install hardhat toolbox `npm install @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox`
To use your local installation of Hardhat, you need to use `npx` to run it (i.e. `npx hardhat`).

## Creating your contracts
To create the sample project, run `npx hardhat` in your project folder:
```
$ npx hardhat
888    888                      888 888               888
888    888                      888 888               888
888    888                      888 888               888

## Compiling your contracts
Next, if you take a look at the `contracts/` folder, you'll see `Lock.sol`:
```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.9;

// Uncomment this line to use console.log
// import "hardhat/console.sol";

contract Lock {
    uint public unlockTime;
    address payable public owner;

    event Withdrawal(uint amount, uint when);

    constructor(uint _unlockTime) payable {
        require(
            block.timestamp < _unlockTime,
            "Unlock time should be in the future"
        );

        unlockTime = _unlockTime;
        owner = payable(msg.sender);
    }

    function withdraw() public {
        // Uncomment this line, and the import of "hardhat/console.sol", to print a log in your terminal
        // console.log("Unlock time is %o and block timestamp is %o", unlockTime, block.timestamp);

        require(block.timestamp >= unlockTime, "You can't withdraw yet");
        require(msg.sender == owner, "You aren't the owner");

        emit Withdrawal(address(this).balance, block.timestamp);

        owner.transfer(address(this).balance);
    }
}
```
To compile it, simply run:`npx hardhat compile`

## Setting configuration file
In order to connect to the OKBC network, we need to configure the corresponding network.

To set up your config, you have to export an object from `hardhat.config.js`:
```
module.exports = {
  defaultNetwork: "hardhat",
  networks: {
    hardhat: {
    },
    OKBC: {
      url: "https://okbtestrpc.okx.com",
      accounts: [privateKey1, privateKey2, ...]
    }
  }
}
```
## Deploying your contracts
Next, to deploy the contract, we will use a Hardhat script.
Inside the `scripts/` folder you will find a file with the following code:
```
// We require the Hardhat Runtime Environment explicitly here. This is optional
// but useful for running the script in a standalone fashion through `node <script>`.
//
// You can also run a script with `npx hardhat run <script>`. If you do that, Hardhat
// will compile your contracts, add the Hardhat Runtime Environment's members to the
// global scope, and execute the script.
const hre = require("hardhat");

async function main() {
  const currentTimestampInSeconds = Math.round(Date.now() / 1000);
  const unlockTime = currentTimestampInSeconds + 60;

  const lockedAmount = hre.ethers.utils.parseEther("0.001");

  const Lock = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("Lock");
  const lock = await Lock.deploy(unlockTime, { value: lockedAmount });

  await lock.deployed();

  console.log(
    `Lock with ${ethers.utils.formatEther(
      lockedAmount
    )}ETH and unlock timestamp ${unlockTime} deployed to ${lock.address}`
  );
}

// We recommend this pattern to be able to use async/await everywhere
// and properly handle errors.
main().catch((error) => {
  console.error(error);
  process.exitCode = 1;
});
```
You can run it using `npx hardhat run`:
```
$ npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network OKBC
Lock with 1 ETH deployed to: 0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3
```
